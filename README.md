# Balboa GL ML Spa Control

While there is the excellent https://github.com/ccutrer/balboa_worldwide_app project that handled the new WiFi capable BP range of controllers, this is *NOT* compatible with the older GL/EL range such as the GL2000.

At the moment this protect is just to pull together the information that has been established.
